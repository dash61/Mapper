I set 2 env vars for debug:
export PUBLIC_URL='.'
export NODE_ENV='development'
AFTER YOU SET THESE, CLOSE CHROME COMPLETELY AND RESTART IT.

I also tried:
export PUBLIC_URL='./public'
in order to point to the public dir; see webpack.config.dev.js, cmts for InterpolateHtmlPlugin.

To run this:
1) Open Chrome
2) In your terminal window set to the mapprj3 directory, do:
   $ npm start
3) Chrome will display the app at localhost:3000.
4) To see console.log output, as usual right click in the chrome window
   and select "Inspect". In the window that opens, find the console.
